# DoorMats
Alternative version of the doormat mod. The original version works by making pawns drop a single filth stack regularly if they are on a doormat. This version makes them drop a single stack too, but clears any other filth they might still have on them, so no matter how much filth they have on them it will be condensed into a single stack.

The result is that the doormats are far more powerful in keeping your base clean. Note that this is not necessarily balanced.
